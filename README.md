# Submitting a Preset
If you want one of your presets to become an "Official Preset", open a new issue and attach your .lcpp file.<br>
.lcpc is not accepted.
- **Name the Issue "Preset Request" Alternatively, use the Issue Template for presets**

# Other Information
As of Launch Cam Plus 2.3.0.0, the program has an Update Alert option. If the ABOUT button (At the top of the main menu) is RED, a new LCP update is available.<br>
In the event that LCP crashes on you, it will print out a Crash Log. Open a [New Issue](https://github.com/SuperHackio/LaunchCamPlus/issues) and attach your Crash Log.<br>
Speak another language that's not English? Don't worry, you don't need to translate the Crash Log **UNLESS** asked otherwise.
## Plugins
Plugins are add-ons for LCP that may do useful things. None are available at this time, but if you have an idea for one feel free to let me know.
Do note that the source for plugins is not available for security reasons.
