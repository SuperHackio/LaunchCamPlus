# LaunchCamPlus
Launch Cam Plus is the new SMG1/2 Camera Editor with a 0% chance of breaking your files and a 100% chance of saving when you press save!

Features:

- Allows you to make and share Camera Presets that anyone can add to their Camera Data!
- Comes with *Official Presets*.
- Utilizes the way Camera Data is written to optimize the Data
- Rail Camera Support

Planned Features:
- Previewing your cameras (This won't come for a while, sorry)
- Full Camera Documentation (This will happen gradually)
- Complete list of Event Cameras (This will happen gradually)

# Submitting a Preset
If you want one of your presets to become an "Official Preset", open a new issue and attach your .lcpp file.<br>
.lcpc is not accepted.
- **Name the Issue "Preset Request" Alternatively, use the Issue Template for presets**

# Other Information
As of Launch Cam Plus 2.3.0.0, the program has an Update Alert option. If the ABOUT button (At the top of the main menu) is RED, a new LCP update is available.<br>
In the event that LCP crashes on you, it will print out a Crash Log. Open a [New Issue](https://github.com/SuperHackio/LaunchCamPlus/issues) and attach your Crash Log.<br>
Speak another language that's not English? Don't worry, you don't need to translate the Crash Log **UNLESS** asked otherwise.
