# LaunchCamPlus
Launch Cam Plus is the new SMG1/2 Camera Editor with a near 0% chance of breaking your files and a 100% chance of saving when you press save!

Features:
- Making Cameras (Obviously)
- Allows you to make and share Camera Presets that anyone can add to their Camera Data!
- Comes with *Official Presets* that are built into the program.
- Utilizes the way Camera Data is written to optimize the Data

Planned Features:
- Previewing your cameras (This won't come for a while, sorry)
- Checking your cameras for errors (This will come sooner)
- Preset Compression (These won't be allowed to be submitted for Official Presets)

# Submitting a Preset
If you want one of your presets to become an "Official Preset", open a new issue and attach your .lcpp file.
- **Name the Issue "Preset Request"**
